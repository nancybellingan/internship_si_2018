SiLayersDep = 0 if not to enable the energy deposition scoring in the active layer of the silicon, 1 for scoring and getting the data for the histogram
EnableRoom  = 0 if the concrete walls aren´t wanted, 1 if the radiation labor geometry is implemented
SphereScorer = to enable the sphere radius 10 cm around the am-be source scoring crossing E-kin for neutrons
DummyScorer = if enabled, it´s a scorer for kinetic energy of neutrons with the volume of the housing of the sensors
Sourcexcm ... cm = x position of the am-be source relative to the center of the world
Sourceycm .... cm = y position of the am-be source relative to the center of the world
Sourcezcm ... cm = z position of the am-be source relative to the center of the world
distancephantsurf = distance of the phantom closest surface to the am-be source
print_stored_trajectories = if print the stored trajectories or not (?)
Iondummy 0 = for the future, not really used now
multithreading 1 = careful, if multithreading is on, some parts of the code such as the total spectra for the ekin of neutrons in dummies, wont work
numbercores = number of cores for the multithreading
albedocentre = if 0, the fast sensor is put at same x and y of the am-be, if 1, the albedo is
totdata = if the total sum of dummies e-kin per binning is wanted, then it will be created a new output file at the end of the whole simulation with cumulative data for histogram. 
phantomon = if 0, the phantom is disactivated, if 1, the phantom is enabled.
